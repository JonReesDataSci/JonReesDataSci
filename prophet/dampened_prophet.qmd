#  Prophet timeseries (Using dampening to constrain trends)

Prophet, while an excellent tool for timeseries forecasting, has a bad habbit of sending predictions into orbit based on data that has a pronounced increase or decrease in the latter part of the data. (Considering the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on almost all timeseries data, this could prove problematic)
Fortunately this can be constrained using a technique known as dampening. This constrains the trend element of Prophets forecasts, keeping the predicted patterns looking far more reasonable.
